##  Project 1 â€“ Sorting Performance Analysis

Compares the execution time of three classic sorting algorithms â€” **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Bubble Sort** â€” across randomly generated arrays of various sizes.

###  Features
- Random integer array generation
- Sorts using:
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Bubble Sort
- Execution time comparison and tabular output


##  Project 2 â€“ Data Import and CSV Analysis

This project demonstrates how to **import, parse, and analyze CSV data** using Python. It reads numerical data from a CSV file and computes column-wise statistics, including **mean**, **minimum**, and **maximum** values.

---

###  Features
- Reads numeric data from a CSV file
- Calculates and prints:
  - Column-wise **Mean**
  - Column-wise **Minimum**
  - Column-wise **Maximum**
